Description: Implementation of the tests for rotational symmetry on the hypersphere
     proposed in García-Portugués, Paindaveine and Verdebout (2020) 
     <doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1665527>. The package also implements the
     proposed distributions on the hypersphere, based on the tangent-normal
     decomposition, and allows for the replication of the data application
     considered in the paper.
