Description: Implementation of the tests for rotational symmetry on the
     hypersphere proposed in García-Portugués, Paindaveine and Verdebout
     (2019) <arXiv:1706.05030>. The package also implements the proposed
     distributions on the hypersphere, based on the tangent-normal
     decomposition, and allows for the replication of the data
     application considered in the paper.
