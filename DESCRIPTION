Description: Implementation of the tests for rotational symmetry on the
    hypersphere proposed in García-Portugués, Paindaveine and Verdebout (2020)
    <doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1665527>. The package also implements the
    proposed distributions on the hypersphere, based on the tangent-normal
    decomposition, and allows for the replication of the data application
    considered in the paper.
