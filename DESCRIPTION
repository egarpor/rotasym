Description: Implementation of the tests for rotational symmetry on the
     hypersphere proposed in the paper "On optimal tests for rotational
     symmetry against new classes of hyperspherical distributions". The
     package implements the proposed distributions on the hypersphere
     based on the tangent-normal decomposition. It also allows for the
     replication of the data application considered in the paper.
