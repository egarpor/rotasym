        27-35    A9     Blank
 9      36-40    I5     Daily sum of projected U umbra area in millionths of the solar disc
                        The U area is measured in those cases when the software identifies one or more darker parts within a less dark 
                        part framed by the photosphere-spot border. 
                        The measurement is exclusively based on the intensity information of the processed white-light image, which 
                        does not allow to investigate whether the darker part is an umbra and the less dark part is a penumbra physically.
        41       A1     Blank
10      42-46    I5     Daily sum of projected WS whole spot area in millionths of the solar disc
                        Each solar feature is classified as a "spot" which is darker than the photosphere.
                        The WS area means "whole spot" area. The WS area is the total area occupied by features darker than the photosphere, 
                        including umbrae, penumbrae, and pores. 
                        This method of determination of umbra and whole spot area results in similar umbra and whole spot area published by GPR to ensure the homogeneity.
        47       A1     Blank
11      48-52    I5     Daily sum of corrected U umbra area in millionths of the solar hemisphere
        53       A1     Blank
12      54-58    I5     Daily sum of corrected WS whole spot area in millionths of the solar hemisphere
                        If every area data is 0, this means observation with no spots.
        59       A1     Blank
13      60-72    F13.5  Julian Date (by convention .50000 represents 0000 UT)
        73       A1     Blank
14      74-79    F6.2   P (position angle of the northern extremity of the axis of 
                        rotation, measured eastwards from the north point of the disk)
                        at the time of the ground-based observation, 
                        or position angle of the solar north pole in the SOHO/MDI image,
                        or 0.00 if there are no spots in the SOHO/MDI image.
        80-81    A2     Blank
15      82-86    F5.2   B0 (heliographic latitude of the central point of the disk on the observation,
                        or 0.00 if there are no spots in the SOHO/MDI image)

        22       A1     Blank
 8      23-28    A6     NOAA sunspot group number if it exists and it has not been revised. If no NOAA number was assigned for the
                        group, a NOAA number was given with an additional letter (e.g. "m", "n", etc.). Please notice that the intention 
                        to separate the nearby sunspot groups in the best way possible sometimes causes deviations from the original NOAA numbering. 
        29-35    A7     Blank
 9      36-40    I5     Total projected U umbra area of the group in millionths of the solar disc

        59       A1     Blank

   The following entries refer to the position of the given sunspot group, which is the mean position 
of its spots weighted by the corrected whole spot area of the single spots. 
If the projected whole spot area is 0 and the corrected area is 0, the weight is 0.2.
If the projected whole spot area is 1 and the corrected area is 0, the weight is 0.4.
In the case of several umbrae within the same penumbra the mean weighted umbra position was calculated 
within their common penumbra prior to the calculation of group mean position. 
If the projected U area is 0 and the corrected area is 0 of an umbra within the common penumbra, the weight is 0.2.
If the projected U area is 1 and the corrected area is 0 of an umbra within the common penumbra, the weight is 0.4.

13      60-65    F6.2   Heliographic latitude B; positive: North, negative: South
        66       A1     Blank
14      67-72    F6.2   Heliographic longitude L
        73       A1     Blank

17      88-93    F6.4   Distance from the centre of Sun's disc measured in units of the solar radius

If all the total areas are equal to zero and all the position data are equal to 999999,
it means an intermittent phase of the group.


Rows beginning with character "s" (spot)

 9      30-34    I3     No. of spot within the group
        35       A1     Blank
10      36-40    I5     Projected U umbra area in millionths of the solar disc,
                        negative values indicate that the umbra consists of fragmented
                        regions which cannot be separated without losing umbra area.
                        In this way several spots (intensity minima in the umbra) have a
                        common umbra, e.g. -2 means that the given spot shares an umbra
                        with spot No.2, and the common U value is indicated at spot No.2.
        41       A1     Blank
11      42-46    I5     Projected WS whole spot area in millionths of the solar
                        disc, negative values indicate that several umbrae have a common
                        penumbra, e.g. -7 means that the given umbra shares a penumbra
                        with umbra No.7, and the WS value is indicated at No.7.
        47       A1     Blank
12      48-52    I5     Corrected U umbra area in millionths of the solar hemisphere, 
                        for negative values see Column 24-28.

13      54-58    I5     Corrected WS whole spot area in millionths of the solar hemisphere, 
                        for negative values see Column 29-33.
        59       A1     Blank
14      60-65    F6.2   Heliographic latitude B; positive: North, negative: South

The position data of a spot refer to the position of the centroid of the umbra if an umbra is identified within a spot. 
(If there are several umbrae in a common penumbra, each umbra has a separate "s" row with its position data.
In this case, the area-weighted positions of the whole spot can be calculated from the position data of these umbrae 
by weighting with the umbral area.)
Otherwise, the position of the centroid of the whole spot is measured.
